# Wiki-Search

"[Wiki-Search](https://alexgooz.github.io/wiki-search/)" allows you to search Wikipedia for articles and click a button to get a random Wikipedia article. This is all done using the *[Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page)*. I made this for a freeCodeCamp challenge (Build a Wikipedia Viewer).

## Outline

The outline of the challenge was:
- The User can search Wikipedia articles in a search box and see the resulting article.
- The User can click a button to see a random Wikipedia article.

## License

Wiki-Search is distributed under the GPLv3 license.
